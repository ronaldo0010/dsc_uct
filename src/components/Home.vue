        As the first Developer Student Club in South Africa, DSC UCT prides
        itself on preparing student developers for the real world, in the best
        way possible. We teach people how to code, and turn coders into
        developers by exposing them to the tools and technologies used in
        industry. Our developers then become drivers of change, as they use
        what they have learnt to build tech solutions to local and global
        issues.
